# webmonitor

Introducing myself to Python

I needed to follow some important changes on a website. 
Instead of refreshing it, I build the web monitor, which would inform me when changes happened.
The project follows the tutorial made by Paul Bitutsky -> https://medium.com/swlh/tutorial-creating-a-webpage-monitor-using-python-and-running-it-on-a-raspberry-pi-df763c142dac
Thank you, Paul!
